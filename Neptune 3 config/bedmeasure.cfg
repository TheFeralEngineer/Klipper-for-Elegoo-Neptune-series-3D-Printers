#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
